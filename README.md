# Melody Generation using RNN
This repository contains a Neural Network architecture for generating Melodies using Long Short Term Memory (RNNs).

## Dataset

The model was trained on the  [Kern Score Dataset](https://kern.humdrum.org/cgi-bin/browse?l=essen%2Feuropa%2Fdeutschl) which is a Dataset of folk songs in krn format. The model can be trained using Midi format and any kind of music with a few minor adjustements
